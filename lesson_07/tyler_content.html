    <h3>Tyler</h3>
    
    <p> Tyler is an incredibly rare species, consisting of only 1 in the world. This is a revolutionary tree, helping the industrial revolution massively with its unique properties. The unique look is somehow modeled off a instructor at CodeWizards which is still a mystery why.</p>
    
    <p>The only tree was found in a random place in Antarctica. It was said that it was brought down by aliens. The real reason on how it exists is still unknown but the best theory is that it was planted and Tyler modified it. This is still a stretch, however, because it's in Antarctica. We also don't know how it survived the freezing climate. We believes the tree feeds off of polar bears by making seal noises to lure them and then grabbing it with its branchs, similar to that one tree in that one movie.</p>
