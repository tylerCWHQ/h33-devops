    <h3>Apple</h3>

    <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
    
    <p>Malus (/ˈmeɪləs/[3] or /ˈmæləs/) is a genus of about 32–57 species[4] of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae, including the domesticated orchard apple, crab apples and wild apples.

        The genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
